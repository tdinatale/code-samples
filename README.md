This repository contains samples of code I've written through the years while on various jobs, to help solve specific problems in scalable and reusable ways.

Please remember, none of this was written recently. This is code I've written through the years with the skills/techology available to me at the time. I'm sure many things could have been done differently. I realize this often when I look back at my old code.

The names and domains have been adjusted to protect the innocent. ;-)
