This directory contains a little PHP script for the command line, to clean-up and standardize tons of code in given file.

At one job I had to do so much cleaning of old scripts, including migrate various functions to newer functions, make the code overable more readable, that it was worth investing time to automate it.

It also has functionality to give me a diff of all the changes to check them over, check for any PHP errors, and then save the changes after confirming all is good.
